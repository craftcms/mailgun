This plugin provides a [Mailgun](http://www.mailgun.com/) integration for [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com/).

## Requirements

This plugin requires Craft CMS 4.0 or later.

You can install this plugin from the Plugin Store or with Composer.

#### With Composer

Open your terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
# go to the project directory
cd /path/to/my-project.test

# tell Composer to load the plugin
